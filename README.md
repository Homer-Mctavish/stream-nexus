In development. Not production ready. Many things hardcoded.

# _Stream Nexus for Enhanced Entertainment and Discourse_
SNEED (Stream Nexus, or formally, the _Stream Nexus for Enhancing Entertainment Discussion_) is a Rust project using a headless Chromium browser to unify the livestream chats of many popular platforms, enabling streamers to multicast more effectively and support alternative tech without sacrificing their community.

Inlining your stream chat on your video enhances the viewer experiences, encourages engagement, promotes community, and provides longevity and replayability to your content by preserving the chat history - even when it is archived or reuploaded to other platforms.

Multicasting is increasingly popular as new platforms emerge and existing platforms become more restrictive. SNEED is a tool to help you multicast more effectively and support alternative tech without dividing your existing viewing base.

Unify, and SNEED!
